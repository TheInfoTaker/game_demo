# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal in creating this game was to enhance my skills in game development using the Godot game engine. The primary objective was to build a simple 2D platformer game that includes player movement, jumping, and basic physics interactions.

## Game Description

The game is a 2D platformer where the player controls a character that can move left and right, jump, and interact with the environment. The character is subject to gravity, and there are ground and platform elements that influence the player's movement. The objective is to navigate the character through the level, avoiding obstacles and reaching the end.

### How to Play

- **Move Left/Right:** Use the keyboard arrow keys or designated keys to move the character left or right.
- **Jump:** Press the jump key to make the character jump.

## Purpose

The purpose of developing this game was to gain practical experience in game development, specifically using the Godot game engine and GDScript. The project allowed me to apply concepts such as character movement, collision detection, and gravity within a gaming context.
